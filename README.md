# advent2019
My personal work for https://adventofcode.com/2019/about

Each day is separated into its own `day#.ipynb` which lives inside the notebooks folder. When a function is needed from a different day, that function is integrated into `advent.py` so that it can be imported. Folder structure may change as the contest develops.
